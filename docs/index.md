Welcome to TeXodachi (_tekodachi_), a collection of LaTeX templates to help you create well-formatted documents with ease! Some of these templates were made from scratch at different points in my life, while others are modified versions of templates I’ve received—where applicable, proper attribution is given. Inspired by a certain ink-loving priestess and her faithful takodachi, TeXodachi aims to make document creation smoother, so you can focus on getting your work started. I hope this collection helps everyone, and feel free to use, edit, redistribute, or fork the repo. Wah!
